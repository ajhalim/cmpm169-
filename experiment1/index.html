			<h1>Experiment 1 - Getting Started</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>Student response: </p>
				<p>I started with the base template given by you at https://github.com/wmodes/creative-coding-template. I just went to the git made it a template on my git repo's and clones that repo to my local machine. Then also did some minor adjustments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>Student response: </p>
				<p>I just changed some of the headers and p tags to things more relavant to me. Changed it to my name, added a link to my itch, added a link to each of the experiments despite not doing them all yet and changed the cat pic to a rat.</p>
				<p>did the image via placing a new image in the image folder, naming it something easy to type up and called it up via a href, the links are just a tags with either a link to something online(my itch) or a link to a different local dir</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>Student response: </p>
				<P>I used the template as a base for the website and just gave it more things involving me. It has some minor information more relavant to me, an image I relate greatly to and in my opinion the most important being a link to my itch.</P>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>Student response: </p>
					<p>I didn't work with a team here, I just made my website with your template, all the text there + image embedding and links are my work.</p>
				</ul>
