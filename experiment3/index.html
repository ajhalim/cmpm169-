			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>

				<p>Started with an example given on the website http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/. Looked through a few examples and unfortunately only found one I really understood and found interesting. The one I found and tweaked around was one that drew lines in a way that felt like an organic process, something akin to trees. I also found a funny cat one but couldn’t figure how it worked https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2065525. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>

				<p>	I just fiddled with the cat one for awhile only to realize I had no good idea how it worked, so in the last day of the assignment I had to work with I just went and did the lines one and changed a few variables and also added some color variation I thought looked neat, had to do some tweaks such that it wasn’t strobing noise. The cat one was cool, I wish I could get it to work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>

				<p>After giving up on the cats I just went for funny lines, I wanted to first tweak the funny lines such that they smoothly changed color throughout the runtime, but couldn't figure that out, instead I made the background change. Issue there was that it was very strobey and kind of annoying. I remedied that by making a small gradual change in color, but then I realized it tended to go into a direction and stay there colorwise which wasn’t interesting. So then I just made it a fairly narrow range it kinda looks like what I think fireflies would look like in a more chill rave, or if they were to fly above a concert. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>

					<p>First high was finding the cats, then it was just a lot of lows of seeing time being wasted on this cool cat thing I could not understand how to alter without breaking it. So then I went for something easier which was a kind of high I guess? Finding something more understandable was comforting I suppose. Then another smaller high came up when I was able to change the background to something a little more interesting than just black. Had a minor low then the lines stopped working, but that’s ok because now it looks like little fireflies fizzing about over a changing BG like a rave/night festival with cool light displays</p>
