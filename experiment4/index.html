			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>

				<p>Started with an example given on the website https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2133405. Looked through a few examples and unfortunately only found one I really understood and found interesting. I initially wanted to do some funny video pixel editing but alas couldn't figure how to make it so with the video I had in mind, so instead I did what I knew how to do which was just have a video be pausable, playable and mutable. I wanted to do some rasterization or maybe even the brush thing, but every time I tried I got some strange engine related error, something regarding too many calls to canvas? So I just made a semi-functional bare bones video player that plays a dumb meme I like. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>

				<p>I fiddled with some code from https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2133405. I liked the pixelatization thing they did, but couldn’t figure out how to do it. Had a few issues first with strange syntax and keywords unique to the website and not any libraries. After that I tried other examples but got a strange warning that just broke my page. Not sure why it didn’t work because looking up those warnings didn’t give anything usable. So then I just gave up and went for something I knew I could do. Simple buttons that allow the user to start, stop and mute the video.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>

				<p>After giving up on pixel fiddling I did what I knew I could do. Simple button work changed the video in simple ways. I just made 3 buttons, one that started it, one that stopped it and one that muted it. I guess I innovated on the video in how the original I worked off of showed a video and that video just kept going where mine doesn’t edit the video’s qualities but instead changes it’s function. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>

					<p>First high was finding stuff and it was just all lows from then on out. Frustrated with the code, frustrated with libraries. Just kept running into issue after issue with noting of note to show for and just worked with a simple button system. It just plays, pauses and mutes. Not very interesting to me… Just like last time</p>
				</ul>
