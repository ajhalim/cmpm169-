			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>

				<p>Started with an example given on the website https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2131930 . This time I decided to scope down and just fiddle with something I knew I could do and understand in like 15 minutes. I found the code, looked up some p5.js references and just went to it. I mostly just wanted to make it interactive so I fiddled with some mouse position stuff. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>

				<p>I fiddled with some code from https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2131930. Honestly I just thought it’d be easy to do with how p5.js seems to handle 3d and webgl stuff pretty easily so I just went ahead and did it for lack of better words. I took the code I saw and just worked on it, there really isn’t much to say about this. I guess I also skimmed a few other examples from openprocessing but didn’t really snip code from them. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>

				<p>Kept my scope simple this time so it was pretty easy to innovate, just made rotation, size and shape of the shape be determined by mouseX and Y position. So now it rotates depending on mouse x and y pos, had to divide the pos values so it wouldn’t be massive at the start and a visual nightmare to say the least. Also made it change shape depending on said positions. Sadly I couldn’t get color to work though.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>

					<p>First high was finding a simple example that worked and was pretty cool to look at. Second high was finding out that shapes are super easy in p5.js. Only low was not knowing how colors worked. Ended with a high that was just finishing it in way that was kinda cool and fairly easy to do.</p>
				</ul>
