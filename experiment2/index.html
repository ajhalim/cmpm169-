			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>Started with the examples given on the website http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/. Looked through a few examples and found 3 I thought I understood well enough and tried to merge them into one file. 2 of them read the mouse x y POS one changes the canvas color value the other changed a shapes size. The last was some basic perlin noise.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>I just merged all three things together, I started with the base of the shape changing one based of mouse pos, then I added the color one and make it only apply to the shape and lastly I applied a pretty light perlin noise function on size, color, shape and line fill so there'd be some cool minor variations whenever you moved the mouse</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>Oh my innovation was merging the three and I guess also tweaking them so it wasn't an absolute mess on the eyes. I suppose the novelty came form the tweaking such that it started as something that was almost and asssault on the eyes to something a little more pleasant with some variations</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I did all of it, I didn't work with a team here</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>I just fiddled around with various examples given and tried to fiddle around with a few I thought were cool. Of the ones I thought were cool I had a decent understanding of only a handful and picked from that handful there were three I wanted to merge into eachother as one project. I like the end product, it's cool to me but I wish I knew more so I could do a few more things like things that involve text files.</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>First high was seeing the examples and how thye were open source and fiddleable and not to hard to learn from. High after that was getting a basic prototype of what I wanted to work in p5.js browser editor. big low was figuring out how to make it run on my website. Big high after was figuring that out in lecture.</p>
